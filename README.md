# JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program on Forage - September 2025
Welcome to the J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Job Simulation repository! This project contains my solutions and work for the Forage J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program.

## Overview

This repository showcases hands-on tasks and modules designed to simulate the responsibilities of a Quantitative Research Analyst at J.P. Morgan. The program covers various aspects of quantitative analysis, financial modeling, and data-driven decision making in the banking industry.


## * Completed a simulation focused on quantitative research methodsÂ 
## * Analyzed a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default
## * Used dynamic programming to convert FICO scores into categorical data to
##    predict defaults
